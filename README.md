# Module 18 No SQL?



## Task 
Given start code for this assignment my task was to test out the api routes for a social media network.
I tested POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE routes.
The task was to get all the routes to work as they should when tested, in doing so I was able to successfully
Create
Read
Update
and Delete.
